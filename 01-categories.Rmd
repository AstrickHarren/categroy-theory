# Categories and Functors

```{definition, name="Metagraph"}
A metagraph consists of *objects* and *arrows* and two operations: domain and codomain of an arrow.
```

```{definition, metacategory, name="MetaCategory"}
A metacategory is a metagraph of two operations:

- *identity*: assigns to each object $a$ an arrow $1_a: a \to a$
- *composition*: assigns to each pair of arrows $\langle g, f\rangle$ with $\op{dom} g = \op{cod} f$ an arrow $g \circ f$ with
  $$g \circ f: \op{dom} f \to \op{cod} g$$

and the two axioms:

- *associativity*
- *Unit law*: for all $f: a \to b$ and $g: b \to c$
  $$1_b \circ f = f \quad g \circ 1_b = g$$
```

```{remark}
Since every object is assigned a unique (by unit law) identity, a metacategory can be viewed as composed of entirely arrows by identifying each object with its identity.
```

```{definition, name="Morphism"}
The arrows of any metacategory is called its morphisms.
```

```{definition, name="Directed Graph"}
A directed graph is a set $O$ of objects and a set $A$ of arrows, and two functions
$$
\op{dom}: A \to O, \quad \op{cod}: A \to O
$$

The set of all *composable paris* of arrows in this graph is the set
$$
A \times_O A := \{\angle{g, f} : g, f \in A, \dom g = \op{cod} f\}
$$

called the **product** over $O$.
```

```{definition, name="Category"}
A category is a graph with two additional functions
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{id}&: O \to A, && \circ: A \times_O A \to A \\
\mathrm{id}&: c \mapsto \mathrm{id}_c, && \circ: \angle{g, f} \mapsto g \circ f
\end{align*}
$$
called the *identity* and the *composition*, also written as $g f$ such that

1. $\dom (\id a) = \cod(\id a) = a$
2. $\dom (g \circ f) = \dom f$
3. $\cod (g \circ f) = \cod g$

and that for all objects and all composable pairs of arrows, the unit and associativity axioms (def \@ref(def:metacategory)) hold.

As a convention, we write, for a category $C$, that

1. $c \in C$ as equivalent to $c$ is an object of $C$
2. $f$ in $C$ as $f$ is an arrow of $C$

The set of all arrows from object $b$ to $c$ is denoted by
$$
\op{hom}(b, c) = \{ f: f \bin{in} C, \dom f = b, \cod f = c \}
$$
```

```{definition, name="Monoids"}
A monoid is a category with one object.

Therefore, it can be described as a set $M$ (the arrows) with a binary operation $M \times M \to M$ that is associative and has an identity, i.e., $M$ is a semi-group with identity.
```

```{proposition}
For any category $C$, the set $\op{hom}(a, a)$ is a monoid for any $c \in C$.
```

```{definition, name="Functor"}
A functor is a morphism of categories. In detail, for categories $C, B$, a functor $T: C \to B$ with *domain* $C$ and *codomain* $B$ consists of two functions: 

1. the *object function*: $c \mapsto Tc$, 
2. the *arrow function*: $f \mapsto Tf$

such that 

1. if $f: c \to c'$ then $Tf: Tc \to Tc'$
2. $T(1_c) = 1_{Tc}$ and $T(g \circ f) = Tg \circ Tf$
```

A functor can also be described when the categories are defined by arrows only: 
```{definition, name="Functor"}
A functor is a function $T: C \to B$ between categories $C, B$ (consisting of only arrows), that 
1. carries each identity to an identity
2. for each composable pair $\angle{g, f}$, $\angle{Tg, Tf}$ is also composble with $Tg \circ Tf = T (g \circ f)$
```
